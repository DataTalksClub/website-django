As you mention in the book, usually we act on the model\\'s predictions - as an example trying to prevent customer\\'s churn.\\nHow companies like Google deal with the feedback loops, when acting on the model\\'s prediction changes the outcome, making it impossible to observe the ground truth? Many books and articles mention this problem, but the solution is not discussed.\\nOne of the solutions I am aware of is to have a small (untouched) hold-out group as a basis for model evaluation and for re-training, but it comes with its own set of problems. Is there an alternative method(s)?',\n",

       "     'text': 'Hi Denis Lepchev thanks!\\nYou bring up a really good point about ‘feedback loops’ when dealing with continued model evaluation. There is a lot written about this. I remember reading an article about a company called Stripe that discussed this problem for them in some detail for a credit fraud model they had developed.\\nWe discuss this briefly in the subsection called “Capturing ground truth” as well as other considerations. You mention a good approach. Another technique to consider is to use causal impact models. Causal impact uses Bayesian techniques to understand how a certain “treatment” might have affected a population. It’s commonly used in scenarios where it’s not possible (or not ethical) to have a hold out or control group. This is commonly used at Google and that team has open sourced a CausalImpact package you might want to check out.'},\n",

We certainly talk about how you would do things (and there is a github repo with code implementing the ideas in code) but this book is focused more on common problems and their solutions that we’ve learned in working with customers along the years. Likely a lot of patterns will be familiar to you, if you’re a practicing ML/AI engineer. So this book is a kind of formal collection of “notes from the field” and solutions to common real world problems of building and productionizing ML models. \\n- Following on a bit from my point above, another reason we wanted to write this book (in addition to having a collection of common problems/solutions) was to create a shared language for these ML patterns. Like any pattern, you find yourself using the same tricks over and over. And in talking with other colleagues we wanted to create a single term or phrase that describes that problem/solution. So, for example, the “Bridged Schema” pattern gives a name to the common problem that arises when dealing with changing data fields. This way, we can try to have a shared language of common patterns for everyone to use.'},\n",

I work a lot with Google Cloud customers. We typically work on engagements that span the entire ML work lifecycle. The project specific problems or patterns that arise are so use case dependent. So I guess the most recurring problems then would be the problems that relate to initial or final stages of the lifecycle (since they are broad and similar across multiple use cases). Those would be the patterns addressing data issues or dealing with Responsible AI and working with business stakeholders. Typically the most common problem is in framing the problem and understanding issues with the data. That seems to be consistent across all projects I’ve worked on.'}]},\n",

That being said, for some smaller orgs or smaller teams there is less focus on some MLOps aspects. For example, we have a section on Feature Stores. This is a super useful pattern and important to know about; however, I can image for a smaller org the need for a feature store may be less imperative than for a large organization where you have dedicated teams to engineer features for the models that another dedicated team is building.\\nBut, I’d say the patterns in general are relevant for small or large teams and orgs.

So much of ML development is experimentation (with data, with pipelines with models, etc) and reproducibility is crucial to running thorough experiments.

So, for example, the regression -&gt; classification reframing discusses how you can modify a typical regression problem and frame the problem as learning a probability distribution via classification and binning. One scenario where it is useful is when there may be training examples which have the same features but different labels (I think in the book we used the dataset of birthweights). This way you are learning a probability distribution for a feature input and it can be less confusing for the model. So you’re really just changing your labels, and you would modify your gradient boosted tree to be classification instead of regression. The pattern isn’t model dependent. Does that make sense?\\nOne last point to mention is that this approach of reframing may just not be beneficial to your data or use case.
